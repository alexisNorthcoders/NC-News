# Northcoders News - https://alexisncnews.netlify.app/


#### Back End API - https://github.com/alexisNorthcoders/projectNCNews 

## App Description
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion platform designed to provide an engaging environment for users to share and discuss news articles. Inspired by popular platforms like Reddit, it allows users to interact with content by providing a system of upvotes and downvotes, as well as the ability to comment on individual articles.

## Project Description
This project has been created as part of a **Northcoders** sprint, with the intention of solidifying the understanding of creating a **C.R.U.D**(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application from a frontend perspective. The focus was to utilize **React** to build a dynamic and responsive user interface that communicates with an API (Northcoders back end project) to perform the necessary operations.

Articles on **Northcoders News** are categorized into different topics, and the UI allows for easy navigation between them. Each article has its own comments, votes and provides the option for users to upvote or downvote and post their comments.

This project adopted a **mobile-first design**.

## Frameworks/Libraries Used
- React
- Bootstrap React
- Axios
- React Router
- React DOM


## Navigation
- **Home**: shows a list of articles sorted by created date.
- **View Articles by Topic**: Use the navigation bar to select a topic and view articles related to that subject.
- **Sort Articles**: Use responsive buttons to sort by date, comments count or votes in ascending or descending order.
- **Vote on Articles**: Each article displays its current vote count. Use the upvote/downvote buttons to update your vote.
- **Read Comments**: Each article has a toggle button for the comments.
- **Add Comment**: Inside the article page you can add your own comment.
